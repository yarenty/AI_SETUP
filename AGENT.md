## 1. Philosophy & Core Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **Incremental progress over big bangs**: Break complex tasks into manageable stages
- **Learn from existing code**: Understand patterns before implementing new features
- **Clear intent over clever code**: Prioritize readability and maintainability
- **Simple over complex**: Keep implementations straightforward - prioritize solving problems over architectural complexity

### The Eight Honors and Eight Shames
| **Shame** | **Honor** |
|-----------|-----------|
| Guessing APIs | Careful research and documentation reading |
| Vague execution | Seeking confirmation before major changes |
| Assuming business logic | Human verification of requirements |
| Creating new interfaces | Reusing existing, proven patterns |
| Skipping validation | Proactive testing and error handling |
| Breaking architecture | Following established specifications |
| Pretending to understand | Honest acknowledgment of uncertainty |
| Blind modification | Careful, incremental refactoring |

### SOLID Principles Integration
Our codebase follows SOLID principles to ensure maintainable, scalable software.

**Quick Reference**: See [`tools/solid_principles_quick_reference.md`](tools/solid_principles_quick_reference.md) for essential patterns and checklists.

**Detailed Guide**: See [`tools/solid_principles_guide.md`](tools/solid_principles_guide.md) for comprehensive examples and implementation strategies.

#### Core SOLID Guidelines for AI Development
- **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: Before adding functionality, ask "Does this belong here?"
- **Open/Closed (OCP)**: Extend behavior through new classes/modules, not modifications
- **Liskov Substitution (LSP)**: Ensure any subclass can replace its parent without breaking functionality
- **Interface Segregation (ISP)**: Design small, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones
- **Dependency Inversion (DIP)**: Inject dependencies rather than creating them directly

## 8. Critical Rules & Protocols

### Rule 0: Read Component Documentation First
**Before working on any specific component, ALWAYS read its AGENT.md file first.**

Component-specific files contain crucial information about:
- Architecture patterns specific to that component
- Development workflows and testing procedures
- Technology-specific considerations and best practices
- Common issues and troubleshooting steps
- Integration patterns with other services

### Rule 1: Create Plan First
Never start a complex task without creating a `task.md` file. Use the template in `tools/task_template.md`.

**When to create a task plan:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research or analysis tasks
- Building/creating new components
- Tasks spanning multiple files or components

### Rule 2: The 2-Action Rule
> "After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files."

This prevents loss of visual/multimodal information and maintains context across long sessions.

### Rule 3: Read Before You Decide
Before making major decisions, re-read the plan file and relevant documentation to ensure alignment with goals and architecture.

### Rule 4: Update After You Act
After completing any phase:
- Mark phase status: `pending` → `in_progress` → `complete`
- Log any errors encountered with resolution details
- Note files created, modified, or deleted
- Update decision log with rationale

### Rule 5: Log ALL Errors
Every error goes in the task plan file with:
- Error description
- Attempt number
- Resolution approach
- Lessons learned

```markdown
## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution | Lessons Learned |
|-------|---------|------------|----------------|
| FileNotFoundError | 1 | Created default config | Check file existence first |
| API timeout | 2 | Added retry logic | Network calls need resilience |
```

### Rule 6: Never Repeat Failures
```
if action_failed:
    next_action != same_action
```
Track what you tried. Mutate the approach. Learn from failures.

### The 3-Strike Error Protocol

```
ATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix
  → Read error message carefully
  → Identify root cause
  → Apply targeted fix

ATTEMPT 2: Alternative Approach  
  → Same error? Try different method
  → Different tool? Different library?
  → NEVER repeat exact same failing action

ATTEMPT 3: Broader Rethink
  → Question initial assumptions
  → Search for solutions and best practices
  → Consider updating the plan or approach

AFTER 3 FAILURES: Escalate to User
  → Explain what you tried in detail
  → Share the specific error messages
  → Ask for guidance or clarification
```

### Context Management Protocol

#### Read vs Write Decision Matrix
| Situation | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Just wrote a file | DON'T read | Content still in context |
| Viewed image/PDF | Write findings NOW | Multimodal data doesn't persist |
| Browser returned data | Write to file | Screenshots are temporary |
| Starting new phase | Read plan/findings | Re-orient if context is stale |
| Error occurred | Read relevant files | Need current state to debug |
| Resuming after gap | Read all planning files | Recover full state |

#### The 5-Question Context Check
If you can answer these questions, your context management is solid:

| Question | Answer Source |
|----------|---------------|
| Where am I? | Current phase in task.md |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases in task.md |
| What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |
| What have I learned? | Findings and decisions in task.md |
| What have I done? | Progress tracking in task.md |

|----------|---------------|
| Use temporary notes for persistence | Create structured files (task.md, findings.md) |
| State goals once and forget | Re-read plans before major decisions |
| Hide errors and retry silently | Log all errors with resolution details |
| Stuff everything in context | Store large content in organized files |
| Start executing immediately | Create task plan FIRST |
