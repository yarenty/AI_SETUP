# AI Agent Setup Template

A comprehensive template for setting up AI agent documentation and workflows in any software project. This template provides structure, guidelines, and best practices for working effectively with AI coding assistants like Claude, Gemini, or Cursor.

## 🎯 Purpose

This template helps you:
- Establish clear communication protocols with AI agents
- Maintain consistent development workflows
- Prevent common AI coding pitfalls
- Scale AI-assisted development across teams
- Document architectural decisions and patterns

## 📋 What's Included

- **`AGENT.md`** - Comprehensive AI agent guidelines and project documentation
- **`tools/task_template.md`** - Structured template for complex task planning
- **Architecture patterns** - Best practices for AI-assisted development
- **Quality standards** - Code quality and documentation guidelines
- **Error handling protocols** - Systematic approach to debugging and issue resolution

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Copy Template to Your Project

```bash
# Copy the entire SETUP directory to your project root
cp -r SETUP/* /path/to/your/project/
```

### 2. Customize for Your Project

1. **Replace placeholders** in `AGENT.md`:
   - `{PROJECT}` → Your project name
   - `{tbd}` → Project-specific information

2. **Update project identity section** with:
   - Project purpose and core value
   - Technology stack
   - Architecture overview
   - Component structure

3. **Customize workflows** for your development process

### 3. Initialize Your First AI Session

Share the `AGENT.md` file with your AI assistant at the beginning of each session to establish context and guidelines.

## 🏗️ Template Structure

### Core Philosophy
- **Incremental progress** over big bang changes
- **Learn from existing code** before implementing new features
- **Clear intent** over clever implementations
- **Simple solutions** over complex architectures

### Quality Framework
- English-only documentation
- Self-documenting code with clear naming
- Composition over inheritance
- Proactive testing and validation

### Task Management
- Structured planning with `task.md` files
- Phase-based development approach
- Error logging and resolution tracking
- Progress documentation

## 🔧 Key Workflows

### For Complex Tasks
1. Create `task.md` using the provided template
2. Break work into manageable phases
3. Track decisions and errors systematically
4. Update progress regularly

### For AI Agents
1. Read component-specific `AGENT.md` files first
2. Follow the 3-strike error protocol
3. Use the 2-action rule for information preservation
4. Maintain clear documentation of changes

## 📖 Best Practices

### Before Starting Development
- [ ] Review project's `AGENT.md` file
- [ ] Read component-specific documentation
- [ ] Create task plan for complex work
- [ ] Understand existing code patterns

### During Development
- [ ] Follow established architectural patterns
- [ ] Log errors and resolutions
- [ ] Test incrementally
- [ ] Document decisions and rationale

### After Development
- [ ] Update relevant documentation
- [ ] Mark task phases as complete
- [ ] Review and clean up temporary files
- [ ] Share learnings with the team

## 🎛️ Customization Guide

### Project-Specific Sections to Update

1. **Technology Stack** - List your languages, frameworks, tools
2. **Architecture** - Describe your system structure
3. **Component Documentation** - Add links to component-specific guides
4. **Workflows** - Customize for your development process
5. **Implementation Status** - Track your project's current state

### Adding Component-Specific Guides

For each major component, create an `AGENT.md` file containing:
- Component purpose and responsibilities
- Architecture patterns specific to that component
- Development and testing workflows
- Integration patterns with other services
- Common issues and troubleshooting

## 🤝 Contributing

When working with this template:

1. Keep guidelines updated as your project evolves
2. Document new patterns and architectural decisions
3. Share successful AI workflows with your team
4. Continuously improve the task planning templates

## 📚 Additional Resources

- **Task Planning** - Use `tools/task_template.md` for complex work
- **Error Protocols** - Follow the 3-strike methodology for debugging
- **Quality Standards** - Maintain consistent code quality across AI sessions
- **Architecture Documentation** - Keep component guides up-to-date

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Always read component documentation first** before making changes
- **Create task plans** for any work spanning multiple steps
- **Log all errors** to prevent repeated mistakes
- **Update documentation** as your project evolves
